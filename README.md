Polarization is a property of a radio wave that describes the shape of its electric field vector as a function of time. In general, the tip of the electric field vector (see sidebar) traces an elliptical path as it passes a point in space. Circular and linear polarizations are familiar but special cases of the more general elliptical polarization.
